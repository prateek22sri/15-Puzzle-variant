# 15-Puzzle-variant
Variant of the 15-puzzle, but with the following important change when the empty tile is on the edge of the board,
the tile on the opposite side of the board can be slid into the opening. 
The goal of the puzzle is to find the shortest possible sequence of moves that restores the canonical configuration given 
an initial board configuration provided in a text file called "input.txt" by the user.

To run the code, type the following in the terminal after cloning the repo:
python solver15.py input.txt
